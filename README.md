This repository contains the code used for my seminar on Gaussian Processes and safe Bayesian optimization. The project focuses on two main components:

Gaussian Process Visualization: Custom implementations for creating comprehensive visualizations of Gaussian Processes.

SafeOpt-MC Algorithm: Copie of Code for visualization from Felix Berkenkamp's SafeOpt-MC (Safe Optimization with Multiple Constraints) algorithm ( https://github.com/befelix/SafeOpt.git ). This implementation demonstrates how Gaussian Processes can be used for safe Bayesian optimization, where the algorithm must satisfy safety constraints while exploring the parameter space.
